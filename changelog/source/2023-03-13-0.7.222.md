# 0.7.222

## :rocket: New Features

- **Added initial draft of World** PianoRhythm World is a feature that I've always wanted to implement. It's an environment where you can create your own avatars and engage in a 3D world with others while playing music.

- **Added support for displaying images in chat** ([PRFP-956](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-956)) For certain links that contain images, there'll be a preview displayed in chat

- **Added Reporting** ([PRFP-225](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-225)) Still in the initial stages but you can now report certain chat messages and users for inappropriate content/behaviours. You can right click a chat message or user to see the context of being able to report.
