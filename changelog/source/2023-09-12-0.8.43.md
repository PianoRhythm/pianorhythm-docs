# 0.8.43

## :smile: Enhancements
  - ([PRFP-1116](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1116)) Discord Bot _should_ show current players online in its status.
  - Added more general stats (total notes & chat messages sent). You can see them in the leaderboards. Note: These are new metrics that wasn't previously being tracked, so everyone is starting from 0. Also, these particular metrics are only _updated after you logout_. So, they're not real time.

## :bug: Bug Fixes
  - Fixed an issue with users not being able to sign in with Discord.
