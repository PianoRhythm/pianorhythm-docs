# 0.8.26

## :bug: Bug Fixes
- ([PRFP-1067](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1067)) Fixed an issue with crashes when playing certain midi notes/events.
- ([PRFP-1065](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1065)) Fixed the pageloader screen showing indefinitely.

### General Notes
- You may have noticed that there hasn't been a lot of updates lately. I've just been taking a general
  break from v3 and programming. But I've been slowly getting back into the groove of things.
  Thank you guys for all the support you've given so far. ‚ù§
- Some things I'm currently going to or have been working on:
  - Ensuring that the reverb effect works across all soundfonts.
  - Volume scaling sliders for mixing instrument channels in MultiChannel mode.
  - Add a feature to loop/auto replay midi tracks.
  - Add some basic drum loops for when you're in 'Play Drums' mode.
  - Implementing a *Orchestra* like room/mode. You'll be able to customize your piano and also see everyone else's.
  - Increase max users count in rooms by double.
  - Improve logging and to better deal with crashes that lead to audio/sound issues.
