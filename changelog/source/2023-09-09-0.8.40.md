# 0.8.40

## :rocket: New Features
  - **Added Rusty Synth** ([PRFP-1101](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1101)) You can now change between different audio synthesizers. The default one has been called [OxiSynth](https://github.com/PolyMeilex/OxiSynth) and it's not perfect when it comes to how it handles certain soundfonts. [RustySynth](https://github.com/sinshu/rustysynth) seems to do it better. However, there are certain features (such as setting the max polyphony) that I haven't implemented within it, yet. <br/> To change the synthesizer, you can go to `Settings -> Soundfont -> Audio Synthesizer`.<br/>

  - **Added Leaderboards** ([PRFP-1105](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1105)) Added leaderboards about general stats. More boards will be added over time. You can find it on the bottom bar as `Leaderboards`.

## :smile: Enhancements
  - ([PRFP-913](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-913)) Emails will not be parsed (as mailto:*) in chat.
  - ([PRFP-1102](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-1102)) Increased min/max supported transpose to -20/20, respectively.
  - Updated the 3D graphics engine [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) to version 6.20.1.
  - Some backend server refactoring.
