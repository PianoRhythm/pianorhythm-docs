# 0.7.146

## :rocket: New Features
- **Added V2 Piano Soundfont** ([PRFP-900](https://pianorhythm.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/PRFP-900)) I did my best to convert the default piano from v2 into a soundfont. For now, I set it as the default soundfont. You can go to `Settings -> Soundfont -> Load Default Soundfont.`

  In the list, there's the `PR_V2_SF.sf2` which is just the piano itself and `PR_GM2.sf2` which has the v2 piano mixed with the previous GM2_Map sf.
