## General

PianoRhythm's PRO subscription is a paid service to give users unique perks and exclusive access to certain features.
Ideally, as much as I would like to make this a completely free platform, there are some costs associated with developing and maintaining PianoRhythm.

Don't worry, I don't plan on making this about the money cause once that happens, then all of the passion would get sucked out. This is
really just a way to at least break even when it comes to covering the infrastructure costs.

So, if you would like to help support PianoRhythm, it would be greatly appreciated!
Also, if you have any ideas about features that should be a part of the PRO subscription, then feel free to let me know!
You can contact me via Discord(oak_9806) or through this email: system+pro@pianorhythm.io

## How do I subscribe?

You can find it by going to `Settings > Subscription` and selecting a plan. You can either do monthly or annually (_small discount_).
