Closes #456
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guide
We follow the official Rust style guide with these additions:

#### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code before committing
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt -- --check
```

#### Linting
```bash
# Run clippy for linting
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Fix common issues automatically
cargo clippy --fix
```

#### Documentation
```rust
/// Authenticates a user with the provided credentials.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `credentials` - The user's login credentials
/// * `state` - The application state containing database connections
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns `Ok(UserSession)` on successful authentication,
/// or `Err(AuthError)` if authentication fails.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let credentials = LoginCredentials {
///     username: "user123".to_string(),
///     password: "secure_password".to_string(),
/// };
/// 
/// match authenticate_user(credentials, &state).await {
///     Ok(session) => println!("User authenticated: {}", session.user_id),
///     Err(e) => eprintln!("Authentication failed: {}", e),
/// }
/// ```
pub async fn authenticate_user(
    credentials: LoginCredentials,
    state: &AppState,
) -> Result<UserSession, AuthError> {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### Error Handling
```rust
// Use Result types for fallible operations
pub fn parse_user_id(input: &str) -> Result<UserId, ParseError> {
    input.parse().map_err(ParseError::InvalidFormat)
}

// Use custom error types
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum AuthError {
    #[error("Invalid credentials")]
    InvalidCredentials,
    #[error("User not found: {user_id}")]
    UserNotFound { user_id: String },
    #[error("Database error: {0}")]
    Database(#[from] DatabaseError),
}
```

#### Testing
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_authenticate_user_success() {
        // Arrange
        let credentials = create_valid_credentials();
        let state = create_test_state().await;

        // Act
        let result = authenticate_user(credentials, &state).await;

        // Assert
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        let session = result.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(session.user_id, "expected_user_id");
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_authenticate_user_invalid_credentials() {
        // Arrange
        let credentials = create_invalid_credentials();
        let state = create_test_state().await;

        // Act
        let result = authenticate_user(credentials, &state).await;

        // Assert
        assert!(matches!(result, Err(AuthError::InvalidCredentials)));
    }
}
```

### Performance Guidelines
- **Avoid unnecessary allocations** - Use string slices when possible
- **Use appropriate data structures** - HashMap for lookups, Vec for sequences
- **Profile critical paths** - Use benchmarks for performance-sensitive code
- **Minimize database queries** - Batch operations when possible
- **Cache frequently accessed data** - Use Redis for hot data

### Security Guidelines
- **Validate all inputs** - Never trust user input
- **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
- **Hash passwords properly** - Use bcrypt or similar
- **Sanitize outputs** - Prevent XSS attacks
- **Log security events** - Track authentication attempts
- **Follow principle of least privilege** - Minimal required permissions

## üîç Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Ensure tests pass** - Run full test suite
2. **Update documentation** - Include relevant docs updates
3. **Check code coverage** - Maintain or improve coverage
4. **Verify formatting** - Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
