import BaseScreenShot from '@site/src/components/BaseScreenShot';

A soundfont is typically comprised of a collection of _instruments_ or technically called _presets._
By default, PianoRhythm will load the very first instrument available.
In a standard General MIDI set, it's typically the grand piano.

To show the instruments/presets list, you can do so by pressing `F1` (_default shortcut_) or
by clicking `Tools > Instrument Selection` in the dock:

<BaseScreenShot version={"0.7.5"} src={"/img/tutorials/efe6e6d5c8dda769990427aa28f16996.gif"} />

Once you have the list visible, you can use an instrument by simply clicking on the element.
By default, it'll load in the first channel (0), in the channel slots in the dock.

<BaseScreenShot version={"0.7.5"} src={"/img/tutorials/484e3e3eda78cccbbd4115913ce0f43d.png"} />

You can also drag and drop an instrument into a slot.
